###Bugs

If 2 bookings are made with the same host name, if you delete it will delete the first one only. But if you try to delete the second one, it errors.

Currently the host and the booking must exist if you want to change the waiter

When a waiter gets fired, this breaks their existing bookings

Stop autofiring the first waiter when there's multiple

allergies input as a string but update booking method as boolean

#### Future Features

Waiters to be assigned based on more metrics, like allergies, and any other additional
What we would have liked to add
More attributes for Host to enter
More logic to base waiter assignment on
Standardize the way days are entered, so we can assign waiters based on availability
More logic to calculate the service charge & therefore measure waiter performance by service charge
Suggest when to fire waiter based on poor performance
